Installation Instructions
*************************
0. Remove the old build cache:
  If you have previous ibus-chewing, or change between ibus 1.1 and ibus 1.2,
  You may need to remove CMakeCache.txt

1. Extract source and enter the extracted directory, then:
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr' 
make

Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want to install
in different directories.


To see other available build targets, use

make help
