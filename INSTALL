Installation Instructions
*************************
1. Build Requires:
   Main package: (MakerDialog)

      cmake >= 2.4
      glib2 >= 2.12

   Gtk2 binding:
      gtk2 >= 2.10

   GConf2 binding:
      GConf2

2. Build MakerDialog:
   - Extract source and enter the extracted directory, then:
     cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX='/usr'
     make

     Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want to install
     in different directories.

   - For API documentation:
     make doxygen

   - Build RPM:
     make rpm

   - Run rpmlint on built RPMs:
     make rpmlint

   - Testing (Optional) :
     make test

   - Build examples (Optional) :
     make examples

   - See other build targets:
     make help

3. Install MakerDialog:
  make install

* Trouble shooting:
  If gtk2 binding fail to build, it is usually because of the strcpy bug in
   gob2 (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=519108 for details).

  Thus, MakerDialog is packed with generated source code
  (src/gtk/maker-dialog-gtk.c, src/gtk/maker-dialog-gtk.h and
  src/gtk/maker-dialog-gtk-private.h).
  Should you use make clean to clean but cannot build them back,
  please either:
   - Extract these files from the tarball, or
   - Patch gob2 accordingly.

Enjoy!
