MakerDialog is an utility that conveniently handle configuration properties
by producing corresponding UI widgets and load/save functions.

Indeed, various utilities are already available for building a
configuration/preference dialog with an easy-to-use GUI.
However, it is still necessary to implement the event handling and
load/save functions all by themselves.
Moreover, developers need to implement those functions again, should
they change different UI toolkits or configuration file back-end.

On the other hand, it is easier to make a configuration dialogs with
MakerDialog. It generates corresponding UI widgets according to the
specification of configuration properties, such as data type, default
value, valid values and limitation. Developers no longer need to worry
about the event handling details of various toolkit.

* Produce UI widgets according to the specification of configuration
